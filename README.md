# PostParrot

My first attempt at a desktop application using Electron. Written in JavaScript, and apparently a lot of CSS according to GitHub.
PostParrot can auto-reply to messages on Facebook. You can customise reply text, create a whitelist and setup group message settings. The service runs as long as you let it and keep your laptop turned on (sleep is OK).
